#Year Up Final Quiz JS

#### Time: 90 minutes

###Question 1 (Who?)
Create three string variables.
firstName,  lastName, fullName

Print out the contents of your fullName variable so that it says:

My fullName is Mike Jones  

```
For example: Your fullName variable should contain your firstName and lastName variable.
```
```
You can swap out Mike Jones for your first and last name
```
###Question 2 (Prompt&Calc)
Prompt a user for 3 numbers one at a time - use the prompt( ) function.
Mulitiply the second and third number that the user enters together and divide the result by the first number.

```
For example: if the first number was 2, the second number was 3 and the third number was 10.
```
``` 
You would multiply 10  X 3 = 30. Then divide the result by 2 
```

###Question 3 (Remember Remainder) 
Create a function called rememberRemainder that takes 3 parameters
Your function should add the first two parameters together and when divided by the third parameter should print out only the remainder of the equation.

```
For example: if first parameter was 10 and second parameter is 5 and third parameter is 2. 
```
```
The remainder of 10 plus 5 divided by 2 will be 1
```

###Question 4 (Lucky Switch)
Create a variable called luckyNumber that generates random numbers between 0 and 3

Then create a switch statement that checks for the random Lucky Number generated and Alert the lucky number as seen below

```
For example: if random lucky number generated is 3 the alert would say:
```
```
 'Your lucky Number is 3'
```

###Question 5 (G-Func Era)
Create random numbers between 0 and 100 and store it in a variable called grade
Then print the value of grade to the console.

Next Create an array called letterGrade that has these elements in it
```A B C D F```

Then write an else if statement that checks for the following conditions

```
Grade                        letterGrade

A                             90 - 100
B                             80 - 89
C                             70 - 79
D                             60 - 69
F                              0 - 59
```
####Using the letterGrade array to print letter grade A to the console

```
For Example:
Let’s say the random number (grade) generated was 90 
if the grade is greater than or equals to 90 and the grade is less than or equals to 100. 
You would use the array to print A to the console
```



####Bonus question for those who finish early!!! 

```
Try to wrap this code in a function called gFunc and call/invoke it
```
